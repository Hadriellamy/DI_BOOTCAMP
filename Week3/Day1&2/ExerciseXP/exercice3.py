 #Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
"""
Instructions

Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
Add the following methods:
train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: “dog_names all play together”.

do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
“dog_name does a barrel roll”.
“dog_name stands on his back legs”.
“dog_name shakes your hand”.
“dog_name plays dead”.
