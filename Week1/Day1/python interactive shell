What You Will Learn:

The python interactive shell


The Python Interactive Shell

Python is an interpreted language, which means he can run code line by line. Python interactive shell allows you to run python code, line by line.

Open a terminal, and type python (for Windows users) | python3 (for Mac/Linux users).

You should see >>> at the beginning of the line; it means you entered the python shell.

Developers use the python shell to test pieces of code they aren’t sure about

You can try it, type some python code and hit <Enter>, for example:

    >>> 3+8
    11
    >>> 4*4
    16
You can try every operator: +, -, *, /

There are also some special operators:

// will divide and remove the floating-point
    >>> 10 / 3
    3.3333
    >>> 10 // 3
    3
% (modulo) will return the remainder of division
    >>> 10 % 3 
    1


Using Python Files

You can also store your code in a python file.

A python file is a text file with the .py extension.

To run a file called my_file.py, enter the terminal, navigate to the file’s directory and run:

    $python3 my_file.py
